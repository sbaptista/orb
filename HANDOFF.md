## Last Session Completed

**Backlog Resolution: Closed ORB-123 & Updated Knowledge Repository — 2026-05-21 (Session 8)**

1. **Closed Task ORB-123**
   - Marked task "Implement 'New version Available'" as closed via API with detailed resolution notes.
2. **Knowledge Repository Update**
   - Created a new entry in the `knowledge_repo` detailing implementation details and key insights for the client-side version check, cache-busting, offline takeover layout, and global top toast positioning.

## Key Decisions

*   **Email is the stable identity, not auth UUID.** Supabase can replace auth UUIDs on invite/re-invite.
*   **Atomic ID reconciliation via Postgres function.** Supabase JS client can't do multi-statement transactions.
*   **Lazy SDK initialization in server actions.** Module-scope SDK constructors crash Vercel function chunks.
*   **Insight engine is zero-cost.** Pure computation on server — no AI calls.
*   **Conversational tuning over settings UI.** User tells the Orb scope preferences, AI respects them.
*   **Single source of truth for dormancy filtering.** `visibleProjectsQuery()` in `lib/projects.ts`.
*   **Single source of truth for status classification.** `lib/status-groups.ts` — ACTIVE (open + in progress), PARKED (deferred + on hold). All consumers import from here.
*   **"Active" not "open" for counts.** Active = open + in progress. Parked = deferred + on hold. "Open" is a specific status only.
*   **"Busy" not "active" for urgency state.** The Orb surface shows BUSY/CALM/URGENT. "Active" is reserved for the status grouping.
*   **Database is the source of truth — period.** No silent scoping, no in-memory divergence.
*   **Single auth authority.** `getAuthContext()` / `requireAdmin()` in `lib/auth.ts` is the only path. Exceptions: `complete-onboarding.ts` (bootstrap), `friction-actions.ts` / `ticket-actions.ts` (system-level), REST API routes (shared secret).
*   **RLS is the safety net.** Regular Supabase client for user operations, admin client only for intentional cross-user access.
*   **Admin insights split "yours" vs "all".** Admins see all users' data via RLS bypass — insights summary separates own-project counts from cross-user totals so numbers align with the Orb surface.
*   **INSIGHTS suspended from AI prompt.** `computeInsights()` code preserved in `lib/insights.ts` but not injected into system prompt. Greeting and conversation now use the same backlog context as the single data path.
*   **query_todos is the AI's single verification path.** `status_group`, `show_results`, and raised default limit ensure the AI can reproduce any number it states.
*   **Outer container layout for floating menus.** Interactive absolute-positioned dropdowns must live outside overflow-clipped cards to prevent clipping, positioned relatively to the parent container wrapper.
*   **Push notifications fire from all mutation paths.** Both Orb conversation (`orb-converse.ts`) and direct UI edits (`TodoPanel`, `TodoView`, `TodoForm`) use shared `snapshotUrgency` / `checkAndNotifyEscalation` to detect urgency escalation.
*   **Slash commands are fill-only.** Selecting a command fills the input with placeholder selected — never auto-submits. Consistent with Claude Code's slash command behavior.
*   **Client-side dynamic version comparisons.** Server routes with cache headers guarantee clean responses bypassing cache networks.
*   **Consolidated connectivity gates.** Centralized online validation in fullscreen pages keeps modular UI elements clean of duplicate connection hook listeners.

## Next Priorities

1. **Verify live update flow** — verify Simulated/Real client-side update updates and cache clearance on production deployment.
