# UI Component Catalog

> **Read this before building any UI.** Every AI agent must check this catalog at session start.  
> If a pattern exists here, use it. If none fits, tell Stan the catalog may be incomplete and ask whether he wants a new pattern added before creating it.
> Source of truth for CSS: `app/globals.css`. Source of truth for components: `components/`.

---

## How To Use This Catalog

Treat UI as assembly from established parts:
- Identify the family first: modal, table, button, form field, navigation, card, empty state, etc.
- Pick the canonical pattern below and inspect its listed component files before editing.
- Reuse the documented classes and structure directly.
- If two viable patterns fit, ask Stan which model he wants.
- If no pattern fits, say the catalog may be incomplete and ask Stan whether he wants a new pattern added to the catalog.
- If Stan says yes, add the pattern to this catalog in the same change as the implementation; if he says no, do not create a parallel component family.

## Page Layouts

### Unified Dashboard (`ud-*`)
**Status:** Active main dashboard.  
**Files:** `components/UnifiedDashboard.tsx`, `components/DragDivider.tsx`  
**CSS prefix:** `ud-`

The main app layout. Two equal-citizen panes (Orb + List) with a draggable divider:
- **MacBook:** Side-by-side (row), divider drags left/right
- **iPad:** Side-by-side in wider layouts, with a 40px touch-friendly divider gutter and visible drag affordance
- **iPhone:** Orb/List tab switching on narrow screens; divider is hidden
- **Zero-Project State:** When no projects are loaded, the "+ New" todo button is disabled and triggers a friendly toast message requesting the user to create a project first. Use the navigation bar to add a project.
- Full-bleed `MuralCanvas` fractal at z:0 behind everything

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ud-split` | Flex container for both panes + divider. `flex-direction: column` on mobile, `row` on desktop |
| `ud-orb-pane` | Left/top pane — transparent background, houses `OrbConversation` |
| `ud-list-pane` | Right/bottom pane — frosted glass background, houses list toolbar + table |
| `ud-list-toolbar` | Toolbar row inside list pane (sort, filter, view toggle, + New) |
| `ud-list-title` | Project name heading inside list toolbar |
| `ud-list-content` | Scrollable content area inside list pane |
| `ud-divider` / `ud-divider--vertical` / `ud-divider--horizontal` | Drag handle between panes; 40px gutter on coarse pointers |
| `ud-divider-handle` | The visible pill inside the divider, with hover/drag feedback |

On the dashboard, AppNav renders dashboard-specific controls as children (merged bar):
- **Orb toggle** (left)
- **Project search** (flex: 0 1 320px) — search-based dropdown for selecting projects
- **+ Project button** — immediately right of search, opens AddProductModal (hidden on mobile, available via Commands modal)
- **Spacer** (flex: 1)
- **List toggle** — before the global nav buttons
- **Global nav** (Print, Help, Settings, Account) — right side

Inside the `ud-list-toolbar`, the controls are laid out as follows:
- **Project Title:** The active project's name is on the left.
- **Kebab (⋮):** Immediately right of the project title. Opens dropdown: Edit Project, divider, Delete Project (danger color, two-step confirm).
- **Spacer** (flex: 1)
- **Sort Button:** A button labeled "Sort" (arrows icon).
- **Filter Button:** A button labeled "Filter" that opens filter options (active, completed, priority).
- **Views Button:** A button labeled "Views" that opens a dropdown to switch between List, Checklist, and Kanban.
- **New Task Button:** A primary accent button labeled "+ New" to create a new task.

### Settings Page (`s-page`, `s-*`)
**Files:** `app/settings/page.tsx` and sub-pages  
**CSS prefix:** `s-`

Standard settings layout with centered content card.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `s-page` | Page container — `max-width: 720px`, centered, padded |
| `s-page-wide` | Wider variant — `max-width: 1000px` |
| `s-header` | Page header with title, border-bottom |
| `s-section-title` | Section heading within settings |
| `s-card` | Bordered card container |
| `s-card-row` | Row inside card (label + control) |
| `s-card-title` | Bold row label |
| `s-card-desc` | Muted description text |
| `s-form` | Form input styling context |

### Settings Navigation & Updates
- **Settings Sidebar:** Houses navigation for general configuration. Priorities, Statuses, and Platforms pages removed in v0.5.207 (not user-changeable). Platform pill UI also removed from TodoPanel and TodoForm.
- **AI Settings Group:** Keep every embedded-assistant page adjacent in the sidebar: `AI Memory`, `AI Metrics`, and `AI Settings`. Use “AI” for the assistant settings cluster so “Orb” can remain the app/product name and the ambient object.
- **AI Settings:** Admin-only policy page for model roles, live routing activation, and monthly limits. Model choices come from the production-ready model catalog; one compatible model may serve both roles. Use the standard `s-page`, `s-header`, `s-card`, and `s-form` settings assembly. Accounting inputs belong to AI Metrics.
- **AI Metrics Cost Reporting:** The Metrics page owns the token-ledger app-cost summary, date/model filters, provider/model/role/source breakdowns, rate cards, request log, and optional provider bill reconciliation. Rate cards are the primary app-cost assumptions; provider bill entries are secondary calibration or external AI operating cost context. The summary must always show both the requested filter range and the actual row range used, and eval traffic is included as real AI spend while remaining distinguishable in the source breakdown. The legacy `orb_metrics` daily aggregate should not be used as the visible accounting surface.
- **Performance Settings:** Admin-only telemetry page for ORB-309. Uses the existing Settings shell, `SettingsCrudList`, `TextSearchModal`, `DateSearchModal`, `EditorModal`, `metrics-summary-*` summary cards, server-side pagination/search/sort/filter, `crud-card` mobile cards, `perf-*` responsive telemetry controls/cards, and platform table-width overrides. Do not create separate telemetry table/search/modal shells.
- **Mobile Settings Picker:** On iPhone and narrow/coarse-pointer iPad, the settings sidebar becomes a compact icon trigger with a down arrow and version label. Tapping it opens a vertical section menu. This preserves unsaved-change confirmation and avoids long horizontal nav menus without duplicating the page title.
- **Version Badge:** Located in the bottom corner of the Settings page sidebar (e.g. displaying `v0.5.127`). Non-clickable.
- **What's New Screen:** Located under Settings. Displays recent release notes and contains:
  - **Check for Update Button:** A button labeled "Check for Update" that allows users to manually fetch and apply newer app versions.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cs-mobile-picker` | Mobile-only settings picker trigger/menu container |
| `cs-mobile-trigger` | Compact icon + down-arrow button that opens the section menu |
| `cs-mobile-trigger-icon` / `cs-mobile-trigger-arrow` | Current section icon and decorative arrow inside the trigger |
| `cs-mobile-version` | Compact version label beside the mobile picker |
| `cs-mobile-menu` | Mobile-only vertical settings section menu |
| `cs-mobile-menu-header` / `cs-mobile-menu-close` | Menu title and explicit close control so discoverability/dismissal are clear |
| `cs-mobile-menu-item` | Individual section command inside the mobile menu |
| `cs-mobile-menu-icon` / `cs-mobile-menu-label` | Icon and label inside a mobile menu item |

### AI Metrics (`metrics-*`)
**Files:** `components/settings/SettingsMetrics.tsx`, `components/settings/SettingsCostReconciliation.tsx`
**CSS prefix:** `metrics-`

AI Metrics uses the standard settings shell plus `SettingsCrudList` for the request log. Keep the section headers outside cards, then place the data surface inside `s-card` containers. The accounting summary uses database-side rollups so the page does not fetch raw request-ledger rows to calculate totals. The request log must retain the shared pagination controller and table column navigation controller. Because it is a growing operational log, it uses cursor pagination on indexed `created_at` instead of exact-count offset pagination.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `metrics-filter-grid` | Fixed-width accounting filter controls that wrap without stretching |
| `metrics-summary-panel` | Bounded card wrapper for the top accounting totals |
| `metrics-details-section` / `metrics-details-title` / `metrics-details-card` / `metrics-details-row` / `metrics-details-label` / `metrics-details-value` | Ledger-style two-column detail rows for accounting totals and breakdowns |
| `metrics-rate-section` / `metrics-section-heading` | Rate-card section spacing with the header/caption outside cards |
| `metrics-new-rate-card` / `metrics-rate-form` | Visually distinct new-rate input card and responsive field grid |
| `metrics-reconciliation-section` / `metrics-reconciliation-card` / `metrics-reconciliation-list` / `metrics-reconciliation-row` | Provider bill reconciliation section, entry form, and recorded bill rows |
| `metrics-request-log-heading` / `metrics-request-log-collapsed` | Header/caption/toggle block above the AI request log plus the collapsed-state placeholder |
| `metrics-summary-grid` / `metrics-summary-card` / `metrics-summary-label` / `metrics-summary-value` | Shared compact summary cards, also used by Performance Settings |
| `metrics-cost-bar` | Small status/cost strip for loading or compact informational states |

### Account Page (`account-*`)
**Files:** `app/account/page.tsx`, `components/settings/SettingsAccount.tsx`, `components/settings/ChangeNameModal.tsx`, `components/settings/ChangeEmailModal.tsx`, `components/settings/SettingsPasskeys.tsx`

The Account page uses the calm `MuralCanvas` behind a centered settings surface. Its header pairs the page title with Sign Out. Profile properties are read-only rows with explicit, matching actions: Change name and Change email. Both actions open canonical centered modals. On iPhone, each row stacks and its action becomes full width.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `account-main` | Positioned page content above the fixed mural |
| `account-page` | Centered Account content width |
| `account-profile-row` | Read-only profile property with explicit change action |
| `account-profile-copy` | Flexible label/value container |
| `account-profile-label` / `account-profile-value` | Profile property typography |
| `account-passkey-actions` | Register New Passkey and Learn more action group |
| `account-modal-body` | Shared body spacing for Account dialogs |
| `account-dialog-copy` | Readable explanatory dialog text |

### Ambient Dashboard (`dash-*`)
**Status:** Current `/dashboard` page — will be replaced by Unified Dashboard  
**Files:** `components/AmbientDashboard.tsx`  
**CSS prefix:** `dash-`

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dash-nav` | Top navigation bar (mode-aware: ambient vs dialogue) |
| `dash-strip` | Horizontal project pill selector bar |
| `dash-strip-pill` | Individual project pill button |
| `dash-version` | Version label (bottom corner) |

---

## Command Bar & Navigation

### Unified Navigation Bar (`appnav`)
**Location:** Top of every page  
**Component:** `components/AppNav.tsx`  
**Pattern:** Single `flex` row bar. On the dashboard, accepts children for dashboard-specific controls (orb toggle, project search, list toggle). On other pages, shows back link + global actions.

**Dashboard layout (merged bar):**
- **Orb toggle** — left edge, collapses/expands Orb pane (desktop) or switches to Orb tab (mobile)
- **Change Project** — opens a search-based modal for selecting projects
- **+ Project** — opens AddProductModal (hidden on mobile, available via Commands modal)
- **Spacer** (flex: 1)
- **List toggle** — collapses/expands list pane (desktop) or switches to list tab (mobile)
- **Print, Help, Settings, Account** — global nav, desktop only (mobile: Commands modal)
- **Developer Panel Toggle:** Dev-only toggle button at the bottom-right corner of the viewport (visible in dev mode only).

**Non-dashboard layout:** Back link (left) → spacer → global nav (right).

### Mobile Command Menu
On narrow viewports (iPhone, mobile screens), the individual top nav buttons (Print, Help, Settings, Account) collapse into a single button in the top bar:
- **Commands Button:** Labeled "Commands" (grid/menu icon).
- **Behavior:** Tapping it opens a centered modal with links to the full commands: "Print Backlog", "Help & Guidelines", "Settings", and "Account Profile".
- **Accessibility:** The menu opens as a named modal dialog. Command links remain plain links/buttons inside the dialog.

### Nav Buttons (`nav-btn`)
**Used in:** Command bar, AmbientDashboard nav

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `nav-btn` | Icon + optional label button. `44px` min-height for touch targets |
| `nav-btn-icon` | Icon container (centered, `20×20`) |
| `nav-btn-label` | Text label — hidden on mobile (`@media max-width: 767px`) |

### TodoView Top Bar (`tv-topbar`)
**Status:** Deprecated — `components/TodoView.tsx` and the standalone `/dashboard/[productId]` and `/dashboard/classic` routes it served were deleted (2026-07-01); Unified Dashboard is the only dashboard surface now, and any future split rebuilds from it. The `tv-topbar*` CSS classes remain in `globals.css` unused pending cleanup — do not build against them.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tv-topbar` | Top navigation row (back link, title, search) |
| `tv-topbar-header` | Title area |
| `tv-topbar-title` | Project name heading |
| `tv-topbar-nav` | Back button / breadcrumb |

### Change Project Modal (`SearchModal`)
**Used in:** Unified Dashboard command bar

Searchable modal for switching projects. The dashboard command bar labels this action "Change Project"; the modal title is also "Change Project". Admins see all projects with owner names; users see only their own.

Accessibility contract: `SearchModal` renders as a named `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"`, focuses the search field on open, and keeps keyboard support for arrow navigation, Enter selection, and Escape close.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `admin-search-wrap` | Input container with icon |
| `admin-search-icon` | Search magnifying glass |
| `admin-search-input` | Text input field |
| `admin-search-clear` | ✕ clear button |
| `admin-search-dropdown` | Results dropdown (absolute positioned) |
| `admin-search-result` | Individual result row |
| `admin-search-result-name` | Project name + code |
| `admin-search-result-owner` | Owner name (admin-only) |
| `admin-search-empty` | "No projects found" message |

### Horizontal Scroll Nav (`HScrollNav`)
**File:** `components/ui/HScrollNav.tsx`  
Adds fade edges and circular previous/next controls to horizontally-scrollable containers (e.g., project pill strips). Table column navigation uses compact circular controls inside a rounded group with a centered **Prev/Next Columns** caption; the group anchors to the far right of the table toolbar and wraps under when space is constrained.

### Filter Kebab (`FilterKebab`)
**File:** `components/ui/FilterKebab.tsx`  
Used for compact status/priority filters in task list toolbars. The trigger is a button with a text label and chevron; the popover uses a `menu` / `menuitemradio` pattern so the active filter is announced and keyboard users can move with Arrow keys, Home/End, select with Enter/Space, and close with Escape.

### Collection Controllers (`SearchController`, `PaginationController`)
**Files:** `components/ui/SearchController.tsx`, `components/ui/PaginationController.tsx`, `components/settings/SettingsCrudList.tsx`
Paired controls above collection content: a search/action controller and a pagination/status controller. Use `.ctrl-toolbar` to arrange them; it top-aligns its children so controllers keep their natural heights.

- `SearchController` has an optional informational top row and a control row. Use `enclosed` for the bordered, shaded settings treatment or `minimal` when only a divider is appropriate.
- `PaginationController` has a page-information top row and optional navigation row. Pass `infoOnly` for a single-page result; it renders only the information row, without an empty control area.
- Table column navigation uses the existing column controller classes: `crud-scroll-controls`, `crud-scroll-controls-label`, and `crud-scroll-buttons`. It belongs in the table toolbar only when the table horizontally overflows; do not use `PaginationController` for column movement.
- Collection owners decide whether pagination exists. The standard offset rule is `totalCount > pageSize`; do not render disabled First/Previous/Next/Last controls when all results fit on one page.

### Telemetry Controls And Cards (`perf-*`)
**Files:** `components/settings/SettingsPerformance.tsx`, `app/globals.css`
Settings Performance uses a thin responsive layer over established Settings cards and CRUD cards.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `perf-controls-form` | Measurement controls layout; grid gap with no extra form divider |
| `perf-control-grid` | Responsive measurement-control grid; collapses to one column on iPhone/narrow coarse layouts |
| `perf-control-card` | `s-card` treatment for individual telemetry controls |
| `perf-production-card` / `perf-checklist` | Production telemetry checklist card inside Measurement Controls |
| `perf-section-heading` | Title/description block above telemetry sections |
| `perf-analysis-section` / `perf-analysis-grid` / `perf-analysis-columns` / `perf-analysis-card` | Performance analysis panel for coverage, bottlenecks, attention rows, and platform differences |
| `perf-attention-list` / `perf-attention-row` / `perf-attention-title` / `perf-attention-meta` | Compact analysis rows for slow P95, high Max, or failure-rate signals |
| `perf-coverage-list` / `perf-coverage-row` | Environment/platform/browser sample coverage rows |
| `perf-summary-section` | Card container for latency summary |
| `perf-summary-table-wrap` | Desktop/tablet horizontal wrapper for the latency summary table |
| `perf-summary-cards` | Mobile card renderer for latency summary rows |
| `perf-filter-field` | Labeled filter wrapper so controls keep captions and wrap cleanly |
| `perf-filter-label` | Uppercase filter caption |
| `perf-filter-control` | Responsive filter control sizing; full-width on narrow/coarse layouts |
| `perf-filter-select` | Select/dropdown treatment with visible dropdown affordance |
| `perf-event-card` / `perf-summary-card` | Performance-specific cards built from the existing `crud-card` pattern |

---

## Buttons

### Primary Action (`btn-primary`)
Solid background, white text. Used for main form submissions.

### Cancel / Secondary (`btn-cancel`)
Transparent background, bordered. Used alongside primary buttons.

### Outline (`btn-outline`)
Bordered, transparent. General-purpose secondary action.

### Danger Outline (`btn-danger-outline`)
Red border, red text, transparent background. Hover fills red with white text. For destructive actions in toolbars and bulk bars where filled `btn-danger` would be too heavy. Used by CrudList bulk delete.

### Danger Confirm (`btn-danger-confirm`)
Text-only red, no background or border. Used inside inline row confirmation flows (e.g., "Confirm delete").

### Row Action (`btn-row-action`)
Small inline button for table row actions. Variants: `btn-row-delete`, `btn-row-edit`.

### Toolbar Button (`tv-toolbar-btn`)
Solid pill button used in list toolbars (Sort, Filter, View). Styled with standard primary button variables; pressed active state (`aria-pressed="true"`) uses dark `var(--btn-primary-active-bg)`.

### Toolbar Primary (`tv-toolbar-primary`)
Primary-colored variant of toolbar button (e.g., "+ New"). Styled with standard primary button variables.

### Text Button (`text-btn`)
Minimal, unstyled-looking button for low-emphasis actions (e.g., "Cancel", "Delete").

### Edit Button (`edit-btn`)
Small circular icon button (`24×24`). Used for inline edit triggers.

### Close Button (`close-btn`)
×-symbol button for closing modals/panels.

### Save Button (`save-btn`)
Form save action button. Used in modal/panel footers.

### Nav Button (`nav-btn`)
See Navigation section above.

### Circular Navigation Button (`nav-circle-btn`)
Strict `44×44px` circular icon button for previous/next, pagination, and icon-only navigation actions. It explicitly sets equal width/min/max-width and height/min/max-height plus `appearance: none`, preventing iOS Safari from stretching the target into an oval. Hover and press states change the background, border, and foreground; press also gives a subtle scale response. Every instance requires an accessible label and `data-tooltip`.

### Move Button (`btn-move`)
Arrow button for reordering items in CRUD lists.

### Sign Out (`btn-sign-out`)
Full-width destructive-style button at bottom of account pages.

### Dev Button (`btn-dev`)
Small button for dev-only controls. Styled with standard primary button variables.

### Pager Button (`btn-pager`)
Pagination arrow button.

### Orb Voice Mode States
**Files:** `components/UnifiedDashboard.tsx` (inline styles + keyframes)

The Orb sphere has two voice-specific visual states that temporarily override urgency colors:

| State | Palette | Animation | Arc Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Listening** | Teal/cyan (`orbMid: #c8e8e8`, glow: `rgba(60,180,180,0.5)`) | `orb-listening` — gentle scale breath (1→1.03) at 3s | LISTENING |
| **Speaking** | Warm gold (`orbMid: #f0e8d0`, glow: `rgba(200,170,80,0.5)`) | `orb-speaking` — rhythmic ripple pulse at 2.5s | SPEAKING |
| **Gathering data** | Current urgency/voice palette | `ud-voice-progress-sweep` indeterminate bar above the icon | GATHERING DATA |

Since v0.6.113, voice speaks each response once, after it finishes streaming: **Gathering data** covers the whole thinking + streaming window (transcript text may visibly stream during it), and **Speaking** begins only when the complete spoken summary starts playing. No visual classes changed — only the timing of when each state is active.

A thin `orb-voice-ring` animation pulses around the Orb sphere whenever voice mode is active, regardless of listening/speaking/idle state.

The conversation transcript remains readable in voice mode (`oc-thread` is not blurred) so the user can scan what the Orb said while the large voice Orb remains the primary state indicator.

In voice mode the Orb is a featured top-right presence: larger than the dialogue minimap Orb, smaller than the former centered voice Orb, and positioned so the transcript can remain the primary reading surface.

**Interaction model:**
- **Tap Orb** — toggle voice recording on/off
- **Double-tap Orb** — interrupt TTS
- **Long-press Orb** — exit voice mode (or conversation mode)
- **Cmd+Space** — keyboard toggle for voice listening
- Text input and toolbar are disabled during voice mode (opacity 0.5, pointer-events none), with a "Switch to text" button visible.

### Orb Conversation Tool Button (`oc-tool-btn`)
Used for buttons below the input field in the Orb conversation view. Styled with standard primary button background (`var(--btn-primary-bg)`).

### Orb Conversation Overflow (`oc-toolbar-overflow`, `oc-more-*`)
The Orb command toolbar uses the same compact command model on Mac, iPad, and iPhone: primary actions stay visible (`Cmds`, `Dictate`, Send/Stop) and secondary actions (`Prev`, `Next`, `Copy`, `Export`, `Clear`) live behind the `More` overflow button. `Dictate` is speech-to-text for the text field; voice conversation mode starts through `More → Talk to Orb` or the Orb itself. This avoids viewport-specific command layouts and keeps the small-pane/iPhone interaction model consistent everywhere.

### Orb Markdown (`oc-orb-md`)
Prose container for Orb and dev-channel messages. Uses `remark-gfm` for GitHub-Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, autolinks). Table styles: collapsed borders, `--fs-xs` font, `--bg3` header background, alternating `--bg2` row stripes.

### Orb Insight Marker (`oc-insight`, `oc-insight-dot`)
Full-width header strip rendered at the top of Orb responses that carry a structured insight (`Observation`, `Coaching read`, or `Strategic read`). Uses a subtle accent-tinted background, uppercase label, and small accent dot to distinguish proactive guidance from ordinary response text without creating a separate nested card.

### Developer Channel Message (`oc-dev-card`, `oc-dev-label`)
Inbound messages from developer AI tools render as blue-tinted cards with the tool/model name above the message, visually distinct from both Stan's messages and Orb responses. The dashboard checks for pending messages on mount, focus, visibility return, BFCache restore, and every 15 seconds while the page is visible. Polling pauses while hidden, uses an in-flight guard to prevent duplicate processing, and does not use Supabase Realtime.

### Global Developer Panel (`GlobalDevPanel`)
**Files:** `components/dev/GlobalDevPanel.tsx`, `components/OrbDevPanel.tsx`

The development-only `DEV` launcher is mounted globally through `Providers`, so authoring tools such as Table Tuning and global connectivity simulations are available on every route. Dashboard-specific Orb simulation controls are portaled into the same panel when `UnifiedDashboard` is mounted; other routes show a short Dashboard tools note rather than silently omitting those sections.

The panel supports four fixed corners (`bottom-right`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `top-left`) through its **Move panel** control. Use this instead of dragging so the launcher can vacate covered action buttons on iPhone while staying predictable and safe-area-aware.

On touch devices, the panel owns its own scroll surface and prevents scroll chaining into the page behind it. Keep DEV panel ordering after page children in `Providers`; `OrbDevPanel` observes for the global slot and portals dashboard controls into it when available.

### Orb Action Circle (`oc-action-circle`)
32×32px circular button base for the Orb input bar. Flex-centered, no border, smooth transition. Used as a base class by:
- **Send Button (`oc-send-btn`)** — green accent (`--pill-active-bg`), white icon. Submit button for Orb input.
- **Stop Button (`oc-stop-btn`)** — red tint background (`rgba(200,0,0,0.08)`), red square stop icon. Visible whenever the parent is submitting or any Orb message is still marked as streaming, so an orphaned stream can always be stopped.

The parent dashboard owns a synchronous, request-scoped processing lock. A request claims the lock before React state updates, preventing overlapping submissions; only that request may release its processing state. Stop marks that specific request as aborted and releases the input without allowing its late stream completion to affect a newer request.

### Banner Button (`btn-banner`)
Small uppercase pill button for floating banners (update available, maintenance mode). 12px border-radius, uppercase text, subtle box-shadow, hover scale effect. Variant: `btn-banner--warning` for amber/warning-colored banners.

### Small Modifier (`btn-sm`)
Size modifier class. Combine with any button class (e.g., `btn-primary btn-sm`, `text-btn btn-sm`) for compact contexts. Sets `font-size: 12px; padding: 4px 10px`.

---

## Tables

### Responsive Collection Rule
Tables are a desktop/iPad-landscape scanning tool; cards are the narrow touch renderer. Any collection that presents rows of structured data must keep filtering, text/date search, sorting, pagination, selection, and bulk actions in one collection controller, then switch only the renderer by platform.

- **Mac:** Tables are appropriate when comparison, column scanning, sorting, or bulk operations matter.
- **Wide iPad:** Tables remain acceptable when the layout has enough width and the task benefits from column comparison.
- **iPhone and narrow/coarse-pointer iPad:** Stacked cards are the default. A table that remains a table on these platforms must be documented here with a reason.
- **Selection:** Use an explicit Select/Edit mode for card collections. Avoid always-visible checkboxes on cards unless the collection is primarily a checklist.
- **Navigation:** Small peer sets can use segmented or horizontal controls. Large navigation sets, such as Settings, should use a sheet/list picker on iPhone and narrow iPad rather than a long horizontal strip.
- **Kanban:** On iPhone and narrow iPad, use one lane at a time with a lane selector plus an explicit move action. Full horizontal boards are reserved for wider layouts.
- **No one-offs:** Prefer `SettingsCrudList` default mobile cards, explicit `renderMobileRow` only for rich exceptions, or a documented `tv-*` task-card pattern.

### Todo Table (`tv-table`)
**File:** `components/UnifiedDashboard.tsx`  
**CSS prefix:** `tv-`

Responsive task list table. iPhone-first: actions collapse below title on mobile, expand to own column on desktop.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tv-table` | Table element — `width: 100%`, `border-collapse: separate` |
| `tv-table thead th` | Dark header cells, uppercase labels |
| `tv-table td` | Data cells with `box-shadow` bottom border (Safari iOS fix) |
| `tv-td-content` | Content cell (title + metadata) |
| `tv-todo-title` | Task title — 2-line clamp with ellipsis |
| `tv-td-actions` | Actions column — hidden on mobile |
| `tv-mobile-actions` | Actions row — visible only on mobile (below title) |
| `tv-row-actions` | Action button group (Edit, Done) |
| `tv-action-btn` | Individual action button in rows |
| `tv-done-toggle` | Circular done/reopen checkbox indicator |
| `tv-checkbox` | Selection checkbox for bulk actions |
| `tv-row` / `tv-row-done` | Row styling variants |

### Checklist Table (`tv-checklist`)
Simplified table — done-circle + title only. No bulk edits. Same `tv-` prefix.

### Audit Table (`audit-table`)
**File:** `components/settings/SettingsCrudList.tsx`, `components/settings/SettingsAudit.tsx`  
Standard bordered table for settings/admin pages. Simpler than `tv-table` — no responsive collapsing.
- **Header style:** Green background (`--btn-primary-bg`), white text, centered. Matches primary button styling.
- **Sheets-style Column Resizing:** Clicking a column header activates resizing for that column, rendering a resize icon (`.col-resize-handle-sheets` double-arrow) at the bottom-right and highlighting the active column with a `border-right: 2px solid var(--accent)`. Dragging the handle resizes the column to the right, pushing all columns to its right without modifying their widths. Clicking outside the headers deselects the active column.
- **Touch stability:** `touch-action: pan-x pan-y` on table, `touch-action: none` on resize handles, `overscroll-behavior-x: contain` on scroll container.

### Development Table Tuner (`TableTuner`)
**File:** `components/dev/TableTuner.tsx`

Development-only authoring tool available for every rendered HTML table on every route. Open the global `DEV` menu and choose **Tables**, then:
- Drag the highlighted header boundaries until the columns look right.
- Enter exact values directly in each column's pixel-width field when precision is useful.
- Use **Freeze through** on a column to pin the contiguous group from the left, matching spreadsheet behavior.
- Use **Unfreeze** to remove the frozen group.
- The tuner detects **Mac**, **iPad**, or **iPhone** using Orb's breakpoint and pointer rules, displays the active platform, and stores an independent draft for each platform.
- Use **Copy configuration** to capture the viewport, scroll dimensions, and all saved platform presets with their measured widths and frozen-column counts.
- Platform drafts persist independently in local storage for iteration, but never appear in production and do not change source configuration until the copied values are deliberately applied.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `table-tuner` | Fixed development-only tuning surface opened from the existing DEV menu |
| `table-tuner-panel` | Tuning controls and measured column list |
| `table-tuner-handle` | Touch-friendly draggable column boundary overlay |
| `table-tuner-frozen-edge` | Strong divider after the final frozen column |

### CRUD List (`SettingsCrudList`)
**File:** `components/settings/SettingsCrudList.tsx`  
Reusable pattern for settings lists with add/edit/delete actions, column resize, search, scope filters, bulk delete, and server-side pagination.
- **Editor boundary:** CrudList owns the collection only. Its add/edit form is rendered through the shared `EditorModal`; do not add per-table modal markup, keyboard listeners, dirty prompts, or custom footer persistence paths to a CrudList consumer.
- **Read-only details:** Use `EditorModal` with `readOnly` and `isDirty={false}` for inspectable records such as Audit Log. This reuses the overlay, focus, Escape, close, and scroll-lock behavior while omitting Save/Cancel controls and any discard confirmation.
- **Mobile cards:** `layout: 'table'` collections render as cards on iPhone and narrow/coarse-pointer iPad. `SettingsCrudList` generates a default card from `tableColumns`; use `renderMobileRow` only for rich exceptions such as Tickets and Audit Log search context. Card renderer sorting uses `mobileSortOptions`, which displays the existing accessible `FilterKebab` menu above cards. Search highlighting is applied to default card text, and pagination/search/sort state remains shared with the desktop table renderer.
- **Pagination:** `config.pagination = { pageSize: N }`. Offset pagination returns `totalCount` and renders First/Previous/Next/Last controls. For log-style or append-heavy collections that must stay fast as data grows, set `mode: 'cursor'`: `load()` receives `cursor` and returns `nextCursor`; the shared footer renders First/Previous/Next. Prefer a stable indexed order such as `created_at DESC, id ASC` and avoid exact counts on the hot page query unless users need the full row range. If the table needs to communicate “Rows X–Y of Z,” return `totalCount` from a separate count-only query while keeping the detail row query cursor-based.
- **Summary data for large tables:** Do not fetch a page's full backing dataset into a server action just to compute cards or breakdowns. Use compact database-side rollups for totals and groups, then use cursor pagination for the detail rows. AI Metrics is the canonical example: App AI Cost Accounting uses `get_ai_cost_summary_rollups`, while AI Request Log uses cursor pagination.
- **Global paginated search/sort:** Set `serverSearch: true` and/or `serverSort: true` in `config.pagination`. The shared list debounces search, passes `{ search, sortKey, sortDir }` to `load()`, resets to page one when criteria change, and treats the returned count as the full filtered result count. Do not combine client-only filtering or sorting with server pagination when users expect full-dataset results.
- **Header extras:** `config.headerExtra` — ReactNode rendered in the header beside the Add button (e.g. dev-only Diagnose button on Audit Log).
- **Toolbar extras:** `config.toolbarLeading` renders before the active search control, `config.toolbarExtra` renders after it. Use these for compact mode selectors and controls that belong beside search rather than in the page header. `config.searchEnabled` can hide and deactivate the text search input when another search mode is active; hidden text search is cleared so invisible filters do not remain active. `config.searchCaption` and `config.tableNavCaption` provide small caption text for the search field and column navigation group.
- **External server filters:** `config.externalFilterKey` — change this stable key when a custom server-side filter changes so pagination resets to page one without discarding the search term.
- **Editor search matches:** `config.searchMatchFields(form, term)` returns every matching editable value. CrudList shows an amber notice naming the query; the form places `SearchMatchIndicator` beside every corresponding field title. Opening an indicator uses a stacked read-only `EditorModal` with the complete, scrollable value and every `crud-highlight` match. Native inputs and textareas remain plain editable controls.
- **Custom row click:** `config.onRowClick` — replaces edit-on-click behavior (e.g. opens a detail modal instead of edit form).
- **Selection column width:** `config.selectionColumnWidth` — optional pixel width for the bulk-selection checkbox column; defaults to `36`.
- **Pixel table widths:** Settings tables that need fixed geometry use pixel column widths (`90px`, `180px`, etc.). When every configured column uses pixels, CrudList shrink-wraps the toolbar, Prev/Next Columns controls, table frame, and pagination footer to the exact sum of the columns plus the selection column.
- **Platform table widths:** `tableColumns[].platformWidths` and `config.selectionColumnWidths` provide Mac/iPad/iPhone overrides using the same breakpoint and pointer rules as Table Tuning.
- **Platform frozen columns:** `config.stickyColumnsByPlatform` overrides the default frozen-column count per platform.
- **External search buttons (canonical):** All CrudList tables use `externalSearchTerm` + `toolbarExtra` with green `btn-primary` buttons. Tables manage search/date state in the parent component, pass `externalSearchTerm`, `searchCaption`, `externalFilterKey`, `onResetFilters`, and `toolbarExtra` to CrudList. The inline search input is fully replaced.
- **Pagination auto-hide:** The pagination footer (First/Prev/Next/Last) only renders when `totalCount > pageSize`. Tables with small datasets show no pagination controls but get them automatically when data grows.
- **Subtitle format:** All paginated tables use `Rows X–Y of Z.` (or singular `Row X of Z.`). Copy the subtitle pattern from Audit Log.

### Shared Search Modals
**Files:** `components/settings/TextSearchModal.tsx`, `components/settings/DateSearchModal.tsx`

Reusable `modal-center` search modals extracted from Audit Log and shared across all CrudList tables.

- **TextSearchModal:** Text search input with `crud-search-wrap` styling, custom placeholder with send icon + return symbol. Props: `open`, `onClose`, `onApply(term)`, `onClear()`, `currentTerm`, `placeholder?`, `ariaLabel?`. Exports `SendIcon`.
- **DateSearchModal:** Date filter with condition select (On date / At or before / At or after / Between) and date/datetime-local inputs. Props: `open`, `onClose`, `onApply(filter)`, `onClear()`, `currentFilter`. Exports `CreatedFilter` type, `shortDate`, `shortDateTime`.

Tables with date columns (Audit Log, AI Memory, Tickets) render both buttons. Tables without date columns (Knowledge, Projects, Users) render text search button only.

### Audit Created Filter
Created timestamps display in the browser's IANA timezone. The dedicated **Created** filter supports On date, At or before, At or after, and Between. Local picker values are converted to UTC boundaries before the server query; general text search deliberately excludes Created so timestamp interpretation is never implicit or timezone-dependent. Audit details show both the browser-local timestamp and canonical UTC value.

### Audit Log Mobile Cards
Audit Log uses the documented rich-card exception on iPhone and narrow iPad. A `FilterKebab` Sort menu exposes the same Date, Table, Action, and Actor server sort choices as desktop headers. During text search, the card renders an expanded **Matches** section for every matching field, including complete Before and After JSON, so matches beyond the default five-line metadata clamp remain visible and highlighted.

### Action Cell Pattern (`action-cell`, `action-link`)
**File:** `app/globals.css`  
Standardized action column for all settings tables.
- **2 actions:** Both rendered as `.action-link` side by side (e.g. Edit + Delete).
- **3+ actions:** Primary action as `.action-link` + `.btn-overflow` kebab with `.dropdown-menu`.
- **`.action-link`:** Link-styled button, 12px font, min-height 36px, `--accent` color, hover bounding rectangle on platforms that support hover.
- **`.btn-overflow`:** 44px × 44px hit target, 28px vertical kebab (&#x22EE;), hover bounding rectangle.
- **Action td:** Uses `e.stopPropagation()` — clicking empty space in the action cell does NOT trigger row edit.
- **Do not** use `align: 'right'` on action columns. Actions start on the left.

### Kebab vs Gear Icon Rule
| Icon | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Kebab** (&#x22EE;) `.btn-overflow` | Action overflow on an item — edit, delete, archive, etc. |
| **Gear** (&#x2699;) | Navigation to a settings/configuration page |

Do not use a gear icon for item-level actions. Do not use a kebab for page navigation.

## Modals & Panels

### Centered Modal (`modal-center`)
**Canonical modal pattern.** Fixed center of viewport, resizable, max-height 85dvh. Settings instances lock document and `.sl-main` scrolling while open; the modal body remains the only scrollable area.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `modal-backdrop` | Full-screen semi-transparent backdrop (click to close) |
| `modal-center` | The modal container — centered, rounded, shadow, resizable. Default max-width 480px |
| `modal-sm` | Width modifier: max-width 400px (e.g. AddProductModal) |
| `modal-lg` | Width modifier: max-width 680px |
| `modal-compose` | Width modifier: max-width 920px. For form + live preview layouts |
| `modal-header` | Top bar with title/close button, border-bottom |
| `modal-body` | Scrollable content area |
| `modal-footer` | Bottom bar with actions (Save/Delete/Cancel), border-top |
| `compose-body` | Two-column grid body (form left, preview right). Stacks to single column on mobile |
| `close-btn` | Standard close button — 28px font, 44×44px hit target, hover state |

**Use for:** Todo edit, new project form, distill modal, any focused editing task.  
**Use `modal-compose` for:** Compose/edit workflows with a live preview (e.g. ticket email editing).
**Canonical examples:** `components/AddProductModal.tsx`, `components/TodoPanel.tsx`, `components/DistillModal.tsx`, `components/TodoForm.tsx`.

### Editor Modal (`EditorModal`)
**File:** `components/ui/EditorModal.tsx`, `lib/hooks/useDirtyForm.ts`
Behavioral owner for focused editor dialogs. It composes the existing `modal-center` classes and does not introduce a parallel visual shell.

- `useDirtyForm` holds the opening baseline and compares a normalized form value. Call `markSaved()` with normalized saved data after a successful persistence operation.
- `EditorModal` owns backdrop/X/Escape dismissal requests, Shift+Return save-and-close, a single dirty-dismiss confirmation, focus placement, and default Save/Cancel footer behavior. `readOnly` supports inspection views; pair it with `showCloseFooter` for an X plus one Close command, and `stacked` when it opens above another modal.
- Standard editor contract: untouched form = Save disabled; a changed form = Save enabled; reverted or successfully saved form = Save disabled.
- Use `headerStart`, `footerStart`, and `destructiveConfirmation` only for domain controls such as TodoPanel's task reference and delete action. Do not replace the save/close lifecycle with arbitrary footer code.
- Search, filter, confirmation, and command dialogs are separate modal families and do not inherit Shift+Return.

**Deprecated patterns (removed):** `.apm-modal`, `.dm-modal`, `.tf-*` — replaced by `modal-center` with width modifiers.

### Selectable Row (`selectable-row`)
**Status:** Active
**CSS file:** `app/globals.css`
**Canonical example:** `components/settings/SettingsVoice.tsx` (voice picker modals)

Pick-one list row for use inside modals. Uses `aria-selected="true"` for the active item and `--bg3` highlight.

Voice settings save/reset actions also dispatch the existing same-tab `orb:tts-config-changed` runtime event so the mounted dashboard refreshes TTS config without a page reload. This is a behavior hook on the existing settings controls, not a new visual pattern.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `selectable-row` | Row container — flex, cursor pointer, min-height touch target, hover bg |
| `selectable-row-label` | Main text, flex: 1 |
| `selectable-row-meta` | Secondary text (muted, smaller) inside the label |
| `selectable-row-action` | Trailing icon button (e.g. play/stop preview) |

Selected state: `aria-selected="true"` → bg3 background, medium font weight. Meta text lightens to text3.

### Todo Create Modal
**File:** `components/TodoForm.tsx`
Uses the canonical centered modal pattern with `modal-lg`, `modal-header`, `modal-body`, and `modal-footer`. The body uses `pf-field` labels, a larger title input, a responsive two-column metadata grid, and a monospace URL textarea. Do not reintroduce standalone `.tf-*` modal shells.

### Slide Panel (`slide-panel`)
**Status:** Being phased out in favor of `modal-center`  
Right-anchored slide-in panel. Still used in some places but `modal-center` is the preferred pattern.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `slide-panel` | Right-anchored panel, full height, max-width 460px |
| `slide-panel-header` | Top bar |
| `slide-panel-body` | Scrollable content |
| `slide-panel-footer` | Bottom actions bar |

---

## Form Fields

### Panel/Modal Fields (`pf-*`)
**Used in:** TodoPanel, TodoForm, any modal form

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pf-field` | Field container (flex column, 5px gap) |
| `pf-label` | Label — uppercase, small, muted |
| `pf-input` | Text input — full width, bordered, rounded |
| `pf-select` | Select dropdown — styled to match inputs |
| `pf-textarea` | Multi-line textarea — min-height 80px |

### Settings Fields (`s-form`)
**Used in:** Settings pages  
Simpler form styling context for settings card rows.

## Typography & Text Styling

> **Source of truth:** `globals.css` `:root` block (lines 1–151) + font loading in `app/layout.tsx`.  
> **Design constraint:** Stan is 74 — sizing is intentionally larger than platform defaults. See "Ageing eyes" in Responsive Rules.

### Font Families

| Variable | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--font-ui` | DM Sans (300, 400, 500) | All UI text — set via Next.js CSS variable in `layout.tsx` |
| `--font-display` | Cormorant Garamond (300, 400) | Orb count number only — `--fs-orb: 42px`, light weight |
| `--font-mono` | `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, monospace` | Code, numeric data columns, cost figures |

**Rule:** `--font-ui` is the only body typeface. Do not introduce additional font families without Stan's approval.

### Font Sizes — Three-Tier Scaling

Type scales by **input device** (pointer query), not window width. Touch devices get a legibility boost.

| Token | Mac (fine pointer) | Touch (coarse pointer) | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--fs-version` | 11px | 13px | Version labels — the absolute floor |
| `--fs-xs` | 12px | 14px | Metadata, labels, badges, captions, table headers |
| `--fs-sm` | 13px | 17px | Secondary content, muted descriptions, button text |
| `--fs-base` | 15px | 16px | Body text, primary content — the default |
| `--fs-input` | 16px | 17px | All form inputs (16px minimum prevents iOS auto-zoom on focus) |
| `--fs-lg` | 18px | 20px | Section headings, summary card values |
| `--fs-xl` | 22px | 24px | Page titles, modal headers |
| `--fs-orb` | 42px | 42px | Orb count display only (Cormorant Garamond 300) |

**Rules:**
- Nothing rendered goes below `--fs-version` (11px on Mac, 13px on touch).
- Prefer `--fs-sm` for readable secondary text — `--fs-xs` is for metadata only.
- All `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` use `--fs-input` to prevent iOS zoom.
- Always use the token, never a raw pixel value.

### Font Weights

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--fw-light` | 300 | Display text (Cormorant Garamond orb count), DM Sans light |
| `--fw-normal` | 400 | Body text default |
| `--fw-medium` | 500 | Labels, nav buttons, table cell emphasis, button text |
| `--fw-semibold` | 600 | Section headings, summary card values, modal titles |
| `--fw-bold` | 700 | Strong emphasis — use sparingly |

**Note:** DM Sans is loaded with weights 300, 400, 500 only. `--fw-semibold` (600) and `--fw-bold` (700) are synthesized by the browser — they work but are not hinted font files. Use `--fw-medium` (500) as the primary emphasis weight.

### Text Colors

| Token | Hex | Contrast on `--bg` | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--text` | `#2a332a` | ~12:1 | Primary text — headings, body, form values |
| `--text2` | `#4a5a4a` | ~7:1 | Secondary text — subtitles, descriptions, user names |
| `--text3` | `#4b6b4b` | ~5:1 | Tertiary text — supplementary metadata |
| `--muted` | `#547054` | ~4.6:1 | De-emphasized text — timestamps, captions, labels. Meets WCAG AA |
| `--accent` / `--pill-active-color` | `#2d5a2d` | — | Interactive emphasis — active filters, links within the green palette |
| `--link` | `#1a6fa0` | — | External/navigation links |
| `--error` | `#8b2020` | — | Error text, danger labels |
| `--warning` | `#7a5010` | — | Warning text, amber badges |

**Rules:**
- `--muted` was darkened (from `#8a9e8a`) to meet WCAG AA (4.5:1) on `--bg`. Do not lighten it.
- `--text3` was darkened (from `#6a7a6a`) for the same reason. Do not lighten it.
- For zero-value data cells (e.g., metrics columns showing 0), use `color: var(--muted)` to de-emphasize.

### Line Height

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--lh-none` | 1 | Icon buttons, single-line labels where vertical space is tight |
| `--lh-tight` | 1.2 | Headings, display text |
| `--lh-snug` | 1.4 | Compact lists, table cells |
| `--lh-normal` | 1.5 | General prose |
| `--lh-relaxed` | 1.6 | Body default — set on `<body>` |
| `--lh-loose` | 1.8 | Spacious reading contexts |

### Letter Spacing

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--ls-tight` | -0.02em | Large display text (tighten to improve readability at scale) |
| `--ls-subtle` | 0.01em | Body text when slight openness helps |
| `--ls-body` | 0.04em | Standard body tracking |
| `--ls-caps` | 0.05em | Uppercase labels — summary card headers, section titles |
| `--ls-wide` | 0.08em | Wide-spaced uppercase (status badges, version labels) |
| `--ls-widest` | 0.12em | Maximum tracking — rarely used |

### Opacity

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--opacity-disabled` | 0.7 | All disabled interactive elements — normalized app-wide |
| `--opacity-muted` | 0.55 | Visually suppressed content (placeholder text, ghost elements) |

### Common Text Patterns

| Pattern | Tokens | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Page title | `--fs-xl`, `--fw-semibold`, `--text` | Settings page header |
| Section heading | `--fs-lg`, `--fw-semibold`, `--text` | Summary card values |
| Body text | `--fs-base`, `--fw-normal`, `--text`, `--lh-relaxed` | Descriptions, prose |
| Secondary text | `--fs-sm`, `--fw-normal`, `--text2` | User names, subtitles |
| Label / caption | `--fs-xs`, `--fw-medium`, `--muted`, `--ls-caps`, uppercase | Summary card labels, column headers |
| Mono data | `--fs-sm` or `--fs-xs`, `--font-mono`, `--text` | Table numbers, token counts, costs |
| Version string | `--fs-version`, `--fw-normal`, `--muted` | Sidebar version badge |

## Feedback & Status

### Toast (`Toast`)
**File:** `components/ui/Toast.tsx`  
`useToast()` hook → `toast.success(msg)` / `toast.error(msg)`. Auto-dismissing notification.

### Warning Badge / Alert Banner
Used to flag when action is required (e.g. a ticket's linked todo is completed/closed, but the ticket itself remains open).
- **Badge:** Labeled "Todo Closed". Small amber pill (`background: #fef3c7`, `color: #d97706`). Enforces HIG tap guidelines, wrapped cleanly inside lists.
- **Alert Banner:** Prominent warning block at the top of the Edit Modal form. Amber background (`background: #fef3c7`, `color: #d97706`, `border: 1px solid rgba(217, 119, 6, 0.2)`).

### Pill (`pill-active`)
Active state pill with accent background. Used for selected filters/tabs.

### Badge (`badge`)
Small count indicator.

### Version Label (`OrbVersionLabel`)
**File:** `components/ui/OrbVersionLabel.tsx`  
Displays current app version. Non-clickable. Just displays the version text.

### Custom Tooltips (`TooltipProvider`)
**File:** `components/ui/Tooltip.tsx`  
Global custom tooltip component triggered by `data-tooltip` attribute. Configured with a 200ms delay and styled with a frosted glass background (`global-tooltip` class). Disabled on touch/mobile devices to prevent visual stickiness.

## Responsive Rules

### Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Target |
|---|---|
| `max-width: 767px` | iPhone — single-column layouts, collapsed actions |
| `min-width: 768px` | iPad and desktop — multi-column, expanded actions |

### Pointer Queries
| Query | Target |
|---|---|
| `@media (pointer: coarse)` | Touch devices — larger hit targets (48px+) |
| `@media (pointer: fine)` | Mouse/trackpad — standard sizing |
| `@media (hover: hover)` | Devices that support hover states |

### Design Constraints
- **Minimum hit target:** 44pt (Apple HIG) — enforced on all interactive elements
- **Touch-action:** `none` only on drag surfaces (dividers), never on scrollable content
- **No hover-only interactions** — everything must work via tap on iPad/iPhone
- **Ageing eyes:** No text below `var(--fs-xs)` (~11px). Prefer `var(--fs-sm)` (13px) for body text

| Fractal background | 0 | `MuralCanvas` (fixed, 22% opacity) |
| Split panes | 10 | `ud-split` |
| Divider | 12 | `ud-divider` |
| Navigation bar | 50 | `appnav` |
| Modal backdrop | 40 | `modal-backdrop` |

## Builder Protocol

### Before creating any UI:
1. **Search this catalog** for an existing pattern that fits
2. **Read the actual CSS** in `globals.css` for the pattern's classes
3. **Read the component file** for usage examples
4. **Reuse the existing classes** — do not create parallel patterns

### If no existing pattern fits:
1. **Describe** what you need and why existing patterns don't work
2. **Propose** the new classes/component with markup, CSS, and responsive behavior
3. **Wait for Stan's approval** before creating it
4. **Update this catalog** after the new pattern is approved and built

### Never do:
- Create a new button style when `btn-primary` / `btn-outline` / `tv-toolbar-btn` already exist
- Create a new modal wrapper when `modal-center` exists
- Create new form field styles when `pf-*` classes exist
- Inline styles for things that have CSS classes (borders, shadows, spacing)
- New z-index values without checking the stack above

### Keep this catalog current:
When you add, rename, or remove a UI pattern, **update this file in the same commit**:
- New classes → add a row to the relevant table
- Renamed classes → update the row
- Removed/deprecated patterns → mark **Status: Deprecated** or delete the entry
- New component files → add to the relevant section with file path

This catalog must stay in sync with `globals.css` and `components/`. Never leave it stale.
