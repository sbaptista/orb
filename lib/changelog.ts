  {
    version: 'v0.5.22',
    date: '2026-05-23',
    changes: [
      'Project codes are now unique per user instead of globally unique — multiple users can create projects with common codes like TEST or WORK without naming collisions (ORB-144).',
      'REST API now supports X-User-Id and X-User-Email headers to scope project lookups when codes are shared across users.',
      'Orb AI project operations (update, delete, dormancy, move) now resolve projects within the current user\'s scope.',
    ]
  },
  {
    version: 'v0.5.21',
    date: '2026-05-23',
    changes: [
      'Conversational project name referencing: updated the conversational Orb system prompt to enforce referring to projects by their display names (e.g. "Orb") rather than system codes (e.g. "ORB") in responses to the user, while preserving tool parameters requirements.',
    ]

  {
    version: 'v0.5.20',
    date: '2026-05-23',
    changes: [
      'Optional project code with auto-generation: project code is now optional when creating a project. If omitted, a unique uppercase alphanumeric code is automatically generated from the project name, resolving code conflicts by appending a unique counter (ORB-143).',

    version: 'v0.5.19',
    date: '2026-05-23',

    date: '2026-05-23',
    changes: [

      'Login speed improvements: OTP reduced from 8 to 6 digits, added "Signing in…" feedback after verification, optimized TodoView to only fetch active todos by default — closed todos load on demand (ORB-139).',
      'Dashboard nav labels: all icon buttons now show visible text labels (List, Print, Help, Settings, Account). Tooltips restored (ORB-140).',
    ]
  },

      'New: Print / Export PDF — generate a complete printable backlog export from the dashboard. Supports All Projects or Current Project scope. Includes all todos (active, parked, closed) with full descriptions, resolution notes, and dates.',
      'Fixed: Creating a project then immediately adding a todo in the same Orb conversation turn no longer fails with "product not found" (ORB-136).',

      'Strengthened the close/done toggle visibility — thicker border and tooltip added.',
      'Fixed RLS initplan policies across all tables to reduce Supabase disk I/O usage.',
    ]
  },
  {
    version: 'v0.5.14',
    date: '2026-05-21',
    changes: [
      'Added inline task metadata editing in list view — right-click or tap the three-dot icon to quick-edit status, priority, and due date without opening the detail panel.',
      'Auto-saves each field change immediately with audit logging and urgency checks.',
      'Responsive popover positioning: anchored to the row on desktop, bottom sheet on narrow screens (iPhone).',
      'Touch-friendly: three-dot trigger always visible on touch devices, 36px minimum hit targets on chips.',
